II. System Summary
      >The main objective of this project is to develop an Online Grading System for the school of Dr. Juan A. Pastor Integrated     National High School. Its specific objectives are to create a system that will automatically calculate the grades of the students   based on the score inputs of the teachers. Its second important objective is to expedite the report card distribution of the        students online through digital report cards. This project falls under 4th SDG because the main beneficiaries of the project are    the teachers and students of the said school. This project will certainly improve the quality of education for the students and     faculty staff of DJAPINHS.

III. Technology Used
    >GUI:  Canva
      -	Before even starting the project, we designed the User Interface of the system using Canva. This design served as the               foundation for the final front-end design of the system
    >Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
      -	Before creating the styling of the system, we first established all the HTML files of the system. We did this to establish          a foundation in order to streamline the development of the front-end design using CSS. There are some buttons that are              needed for interactive purposes, such as popup sections of the system, and for those we used JavaScript Event Listeners.
    >Back-end: PHP, MySQL, Xampp
      -	In order for the system to function and communicate with the database, we used Xampp and PHP. Xampp was used as a tool for          the back-end developer to access the database needed for the project. PHP on the other hand, was used to do SQL Queries in          order to allow the system to achieve its functional requirements.
